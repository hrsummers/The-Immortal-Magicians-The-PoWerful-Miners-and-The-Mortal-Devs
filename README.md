After sequestering myself in a lonely tower for three days and three nights, subsisting only on instant ramen and Mountain Dew, I have found the one true solution to Ethereum governance. Gather round! We need a new set of DAOs. We'll spin them up and hand the keys to the various sets of stakeholders: the immortal magicians, the PoWerful miners, and the mortal devs. Of course, we cannot entrust these DAOs to a single party each, so there must be several DAOs per group. We'll have three for the magicians, seven for the miners, and nine for the devs. And since this still doesn't solve the first mover question ("Who governs the governors?"), we need one master, meta-DAO to rule all the others. I suggest we put @DeanEigenmann in charge of this one. 

<br>
Three DAOs for the Magi-kings under the chain,
Seven for the Mine-lords in their halls of PoW,
Nine for Mortal Devs doomed to maintain,
One for Dean Eigenmann on his dark DAO

<br>
In the Land of Ether where the Rainbows lie,
One DAO to rule them all, one DAO to find them,
One DAO to bring them all and in bytecode bind them
In the Land of Ether where the Rainbows lie.
